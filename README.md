# Slide-Rule-Data-Intensive
Most of these files are just scrap and some homework assignments I did fiddling around for my course with SlideRule (now known as Springboard). The most interesting thing in it is the [project I did on taxis in NYC](https://github.com/ThomasProctor/Slide-Rule-Data-Intensive/tree/master/TaxicabProject). I wrote [a blog post for SlideRule](https://www.springboard.com/blog/do-rich-people-take-more-taxis/) that presents a non-technical overview of what I found.

The rest of the course materials are heavily incomplete and represent a small fraction of the work I did for this course. I generally only added work to github that required a detailed overview by my mentor, instead of having some other grading mechanism.
